# Linux.Fe2O3

This is a POC ELF prepender written in Rust. I like writting prependers on languages that I'm learning and find interesting. As for the name, `Fe2O3` is the chemical formula of Rust, I thought it was appropriate.

# Build
```
$ cargo build 
```

While this may be called __Linux__-Fe2O3, this fork is primarily built and tested on OpenBSD, so who's to say if it will truly work on linux at all.
