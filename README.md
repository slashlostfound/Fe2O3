# Linux.Fe2O3

This is a POC ELF prepender written in Rust. I like writting prependers on languages that I'm learning and find interesting. As for the name, `Fe2O3` is the chemical formula of Rust, I thought it was appropriate.

# Build
```
$ cargo build 
```

Note that the Rust version used is `rustc 1.37.0 (eae3437df 2019-08-13)`, the latest at this moment.

# Binary Sample
A binary sample is also available at https://www.guitmz.com/Linux.Fe2O3
